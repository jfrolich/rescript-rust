# In-Process Performance Scratchpad

This file is for transient measurements, hypotheses, rejected experiments, and slow-file notes. Keep committed facts concise; use temp files under `/tmp` for bulky logs/profiles.

## Current Retained Baseline

- Commit: `994691b89 Avoid copying variant rows during path forcing`
- Tella `hyperfine`: about `2.918s +/- 0.070s` over 20 runs
- Goal: subsecond clean compile of the Tella repo with 100% codegen parity
- JS output parity: 660/660
- Canonical typedtree parity: 660/660

## Slow Non-Icon Files To Watch

- `node_modules/bs-css/src/Css_Js_Core.res`
- `node_modules/bs-css/src/Css_Legacy_Core.res`
- `packages/core/webapp/src/frontend/LayoutDetail.res`
- `packages/core/webapp/src/shared/Layout.res`
- `packages/core/webapp/src/frontend/UI__LayoutPickerStructured.res`
- `packages/core/webapp/src/frontend/TrimTranscriptEditor.res`
- `packages/core/webapp/src/frontend/Recording__Layers.res`
- `packages/core/webapp/src/frontend/UI__BackgroundPicker.res`
- `packages/core/webapp/src/frontend/Page__Stories.res`

## Retained Ideas

- CSS files contain many polymorphic-variant spreads and row traversals. The retained row-field traversal change avoided cloning full variant-row maps while forcing qualified value type paths.
- JSX/Layout-heavy files likely stress record labels, component signatures, and Lambda lowering more than Icon-specific sparse prop records.
- Signature/env sharing should remain the top architectural target because it removes cross-module repeated semantic work.

## Rejected Experiments

- Naively prioritizing ready JS work behind all typecheck work regressed Tella badly in one trial. Scheduler changes need a more careful cap or mixed policy and must be kept only with `hyperfine` evidence.
- Replacing one small `Vec<TypeExprRef>` visited list with `TypeExprRefSet` in a path-root search passed parity but regressed Tella `hyperfine`, so it was reverted.
